# Buddy Support

For my third &amp; final year dissertation project for my degree (2016/17), I decided to design and develop a chat application for those having problems or a bad day and want to talk to someone about it. As some don't have anyone to talk to or don't feel comfortable talking about their situation to someone who knows them. But also for those that want to talk to people and help them.

Users can use the app to get matched with another user and chat to them anonymously without having to provide any information about themselves.

The chat will not be stored anywhere so after the connection with the app is broken the chat is gone making it temporary.

The features:
* Users can select whether user is a supporter or wants support
* Users can select what they want to talk about
* Users get matched with user of opposite (only to one user at a time)
* Users can then chat to that matched user by text messages
* Blocks messages that include profanity
* Notifications on message received
* "User typing..." feature
* Date & Time on messages
* Translate message to receiverâ€™s language
* Users can skip the matched user
* Users can report the matched user
* Users can choose a game and invite matched user to a game
* Users can accept or reject game invite
* Users can send an enquiry or a message to the app company
* Motivational messages when no users are available
* Users can get help via instructions
