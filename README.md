# Buddy Support

A chat app for those having problems or a bad day and want to talk to someone about it. As some don't have anyone to talk to or don't feel comfortable talking about their situation to someone who knows them. But also for those that want to talk to people and help them.

Users can use the app to get matched with another user and chat to them anonymously without having to provide any information about themselves.

The chat will not be stored anywhere so after the connection with the app is broken the chat is gone making it temporary.

The features:
* Users get matched with another user (only to one user at a time)
* Users can then chat to that user by text, voice, photo messages
* Users can skip matched user
* Users can report matched user
* Users can send a enquiry
