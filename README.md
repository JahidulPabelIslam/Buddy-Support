# Buddy Support

For my third & final year dissertation project for my degree (2016/17), I decided to design and develop a chat application that allows for temporary chats and guarantees anonymity.

The idea came as when a problem occurs people tend to keep it to themselves as they find it hard to talk to their family and friends about certain topics. This causes people to feel lonely and isolated as they may not feel comfortable discussing such topics, or believe they will be judged for it.

Therefore the system matches those wanting support (supportee) with someone giving support (supporter) without being forced into revealing their identity. This way users can talk to people on the go, whenever they want, whatever the time. This also helps those who just want to talk to someone new. The aim of the application is that it should help users to talk to each other to solve their problems.

Users can use the app to get matched with another user and chat to them anonymously without having to provide any information about themselves.

The chat will not be stored anywhere so after the connection with the app is broken the chat is gone making it temporary.

**The features:**

*   Users can select whether user is a Supporter or wants support (Supportee)

*   Users can select what they want to talk about

*   Users get matched with user of opposite (only to one user at a time)

*   Users can then chat to that matched user by text messages

*   Blocks messages that include profanity

*   Notifications on message received

*   \"User typing...\" feature

*   Date & Time on messages

*   Translate message to receiver\u2019s language

*   Users can skip the matched user

*   Users can report the matched user

*   Users can choose a game and invite matched user to a game (Not Implemented)

*   Users can accept or reject game invite

*   Users can send an enquiry or a message to the app company

*   Motivational messages when no users are available

*   Users can get help via instructions
